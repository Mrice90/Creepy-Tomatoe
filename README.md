## Simple Pygame Demo

`game.py` contains a simple Pygame demo. Use the arrow keys to move the blue circle.
Avoid the red square that falls from the top of the window. Catch the yellow
coin that shoots across the screen to gain points. After colliding with the red
square an end screen appears allowing you to restart with `R` or quit with `Q`.

```
python3 game.py
```

Pygame is required to run the demo.
