## Simple Pygame Demo

`game.py` contains a simple Pygame demo. Use `W`, `A`, `S` and `D` to move the blue circle.
Shoot projectiles with the arrow keys. Avoid the red squares and collect the yellow coins. Both enemies and coins can
enter from any edge of the screen and travel horizontally or vertically. The
player starts in the center and earns a point for each coin collected. Projectiles
also award points when they destroy enemies or coins. If a red
square collides with the player an end screen appears allowing you to restart
with `R` or quit with `Q`.

Pygame is required to run the demo.
