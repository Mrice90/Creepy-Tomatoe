## Simple Pygame Demo

`game.py` contains a small example game. Use the arrow keys to move the blue circle, which starts in the middle of the window. A red square spawns along a random edge and travels across the screen, gradually accelerating. If the circle touches the square the game ends.

```
python3 game.py
```

Pygame is required to run the demo.
